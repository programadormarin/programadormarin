## What I’m currently learning 📖

Currently I'm learning a bunch of things. <br/>
As I'm working with serverless on AWS, I'm learning a lot about that, how to speed up, reduce the costs and best practices.<br/>
I'm reading some books like Refactoring(Martin Fowler), the clean coder(Uncle Bob), Staff Engineer(Will Larson).<br/>
I take party in some bootcamps about Golang and I'm learning more about.<br/>
I'm learning about Web3, here I'm a little lost yet, because there's a lot of things to learn about it.

## What I’m currently doing 🌱

- I just started the project [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/programadormarin/100-days-of-code), where I commited myself to code everyday for at least 1 hour. You can (and should) also join the project!
- I'm also very eager to learn more about PHP, Golang, Typescript, Docker, Kubernetes and public cloud in general, architecture, patterns and best practices in each technology that I use, and more recently about Web3 and all stuff related with.
